* # Description:
    - For dishing out those password resets in a pintch, Password2 is designed for GW ITSC to serve as a snappy and lightweight password generator that automatically generates a random, secure password with one click. Phonetic pronunciation is also displayed for immediate aid (Although, we suggest you BYOP). 

* ## Usage:
    1. set how many characters you'd like this password to be. (default 8)
    2. toggle between simple and fancy password generation. (default off)
    3. press generate and behold, passwordus appearus.
